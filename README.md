## 1. Assignment 1: EC2 Automation with Shell Script

### What I Did:

1.1 Wrote a script named deploy.sh  

1.2 The script performs:
    - Launches a t2.micro EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2023 AMI  
    - Waits for 15 minutes (to simulate workload)  
    - Stops the instance automatically to save cost  

### How I Ran It:

1.3 Used Git Bash terminal  
1.4 Ran the command: `bash deploy.sh`  
1.5 Made sure:
    - AWS CLI is configured  
    - A key pair named 'mykey' exists  

### Security:

1.6 No .pem file uploaded to GitHub  
1.7 No credentials or secrets hardcoded

## 2. Assignment 2: IAM + S3 + EC2 Automation

### What I Did:

2.1 Created two IAM roles: 

    - Role_A: Read-only access to S3  
    - Role_B: Write-only access to S3  
    
2.2 Launched an EC2 instance with Role_B attached  
2.3 Updated deploy.sh to upload a dummy log to S3  
2.4 Created a private S3 bucket named tech-eazy-akshata-logs  
2.5 Applied a lifecycle rule to auto-delete logs after 7 days  

### How I Tested:
2.6 SSH into EC2 instance using `.pem` 

2.7 Ran inside instance:  
    `echo "log data" > dummy.log`  
    `aws s3 cp dummy.log s3://tech-eazy-akshata-logs/sample-log.log`
    
2.8 Verified Role_A by running:  
    `aws s3 ls s3://tech-eazy-akshata-logs`  

### Security:
2.9 No credentials committed  
2.10 .pem file was removed and excluded using .gitignore

## 3. Assignment 3: Terraform for AWS Infrastructure

### What I Did:
3.1 Used Terraform to create:
    - EC2 instance  
    - IAM Role_B  
    - IAM instance profile to attach Role_B to EC2  
    
3.2 Wrote everything inside main.tf  

### How I Deployed:

3.3 Ran the following commands:
    `terraform init`  
    `terraform validate`  
    `terraform apply`  

### How I Tested:

3.4 SSH into EC2, then:
    `echo "log data" > dummy.log`  
    `aws s3 cp dummy.log s3://tech-eazy-akshata-logs/`  

### To Clean Up:

3.5 Ran: `terraform destroy`  

### Security:

3.6 Used .gitignore to exclude:
    - *.pem  
    - *.log  
    - *.tfstate and backup files  
    - .terraform/ directory  
    
3.7 Removed any accidentally pushed secrets using git filter-repo

### Final Notes:
4.1 All assignments were tested in a real AWS account  
4.2 Separate folders used: assignment_1, assignment_2, assignment_3
